.PP 
Stores bytes of data in a circular buffer\&. 


.PP
 typedef of \fBcircularBuffer\fP struct
.PP
Length: BUFFERLENGTH
.PP
Description: Defines a circular buffer in which bytes of data can be placed, or removed at any time in the correct order that they were pushed\&. The accompanying functionality facilitates all necessary circular buffer related operations\&. This implementation reduces the buffer length by 1 to differentiate between full and empty states\&. BUFFERLENGTH can be redefined in individual files to get different buffer lengths
