\section{InfraRed Rangefinder}
\subsectrion{Setup}
The IR sesnor was connected to AD module of a PIC18F4520, where the results from the AD Registers was stored in the testing document. The AD register was set to measure from AN1, with a left justified result between ADRESH and ADRESL. 
\subsection{Testing Proceedure}
The PanTilt sensor was set to place the IR rangefinder to measure along a horizontal axis. A measureing tape was set up in parallel to the IR rangefinder. A book was placed at a distance of 150mm from the glass base on which the IR rangefinder is mounted.
